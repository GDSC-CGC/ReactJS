# ReactJs Track 2

### The Goal of this track is to learn how to develop a ReactJs application and at the end you'll have knowledge of ReactJs and you can move to intermediate react!

## Pre-requisites :

- Basic Knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS (if you have no knowledge, you can do JavaScript path and then come back here!).
- Having your own GitHub account.
- React Js track 1

# Step 0

Go to your file explorer and open the folder containing your previous react application.  

![Untitled](ReactJs%20Track%202%2081a6045dcdf74fa78009dc27855805f0/Untitled.png)

Open the folder in terminal and run command

```jsx
npx create-react-app random-ecard-generator
```

## Running React App

- Now without any further open this folder in VScode or any IDE / code editor  you like.
- Open the integrated terminal by pressing ctrl + shift + ~ , and run command

```jsx
npm start
```

**By default, the application runs in localhost port 3000 with the address [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)**

- **Your default browser should launch automatically. Open the browser console immediately. Also open a text editor so that you can view the code as well as the web-page at the same time on the screen:**
- The code of the application resides in the src folder. Let's simplify the default code such that the contents of the file *index.js* look like:

```jsx
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import App from './App'

ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

- File *App.js* looks like this:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
const App = () => (
  <div>
    <p>Hello world</p>
  </div>
)

export default App
```

- The files App.css, App.test.js, logo.svg, setupTests.js and reportWebVitals.js may be deleted as they are not needed in our application right now.

# Step 1

Communicating with server and apis in react js!

We will be using `axios` npm package to interact with API's.

We used the command npm install twice, but with slight differences:

```jsx
npm install axios
```

The below are the concepts of react js. **Do not perform all these in your random-ecard-generator folder!**

Sample code to use [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) in getting response

```jsx
import axios from 'axios';
axios
  .get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
  .then(response => {
    const notes = response.data
    console.log(notes)
  })
```

Response:

So in response we get json which can be accessed same as a JavaScript Object!

```jsx
{
	"userId": 1,
	"id": 1,
	"title": "delectus aut autem",
	"completed": false
}
```

## API calls in react js!

Calling an API in react is different (not syntax wise).

In react we have to use `useEffect` hook/function to call API.

You can see the whole reason behind this [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html)!

Syntax:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  },[]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Here's a sample component which calls API and uses its data!

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import axios from "axios";

function Test() {
  const [details, setDetails] = useState({});
  useEffect(() => {
    axios
      .get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/10")
      .then((response) => {
        setTitle(response.data);
      });
  });
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{details.title}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Test;
```

# Task 1!

Now you have to create a user E Card using the [random user generator api](https://randomuser.me/api/).

Display these things on the webpage in your desired order!

- Full Name
- Contact details(emails, phone number)
- Picture of them
- Country, state, city

> **After completing this task Push the random-ecard-generator folder under your name folder in above repo!**
> 

```jsx
// Structure should look like this

// The repo should be looking like this:
-FirstName LastName (Folder)
    - random-restaurant-generator(folder)
        - (your react code)
		- random-ecard-generator
				-(your react code)
```

# Task 2!

Style the ecard using CSS and show your creativity!

> **Push the CSS file. Your PR should contain a  `style.css` file!**
> 

# Task 3!

This step is the final step!

The create react app tool created the [Readme.md](http://Readme.md) file in your folder. Now you have to write about your project in that Readme.md file. So delete all the content in readme and write your own!

> After updating Readme.md send PR to above repo. Your PR should contain `Readme.md` file!
